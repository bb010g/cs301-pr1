{\bf Program Description:} Computes a product of first degree polynomials with
integer coefficients. Inputs come from a file.

{\bf Use of the Program:} The user shall provide a series of 1\high{st} degree
binomials in the following form (otherwise behavior is undefined):

The first character shall be a space or a \code{-} if the coefficient is
negative. The characters until the \code{x} shall be the decimal digits of the
coefficient. The \code{x} shall immediately be followed by a space and the
operator for the constant term. The operator for the constant term shall be
either \code{+} or \code{-}. After the operator shall follow one space and the
decimal digits of the constant term. The digits of the constant term shall not
have a sign attached. The sign shall instead be conveyed by the operator. After
these digits, the string shall end.

An empty line will halt parsing if encountered. These binomials shall be in a
file named \code{binomials.txt}. The program will print the product of the given
polynomials to standard output in decreasing degree.

{\bf Bugs:} Any number provided ($n$) must satisfy $\abs{n} < 2^{31}$.
